Fraud Detection Dataset - Naive Byes Classifiers 

Dataset Overview

Purpose:

Analyze transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013 to detect fraudulent activity.

Timeframe:

Includes transactions over two days.

Total Transactions: 284,807

Fraudulent Transactions: 492 (0.172% of total)

Class Imbalance: Highly unbalanced dataset, with the positive class (fraud) accounting for only 0.172%.

Features

Numerical Input Variables:

All features except Time and Amount are transformed using PCA.

PCA Features: V1, V2, â€¦, V28

Other Features:

Time: Seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.

Amount: Transaction amount, usable for cost-sensitive learning.

Class: Response variable indicating fraud:

1 for fraud.

0 for non-fraud.

Important Considerations

Confidentiality:

Original features and background details are unavailable due to confidentiality concerns.

Evaluation Metric:

Recommended: Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC).

Not Recommended: Accuracy from the confusion matrix, as it is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.
